Paraphrasing Dmitriy Setrakyan from GridGain Systems talking about GGFS regarding Tachyon: GGFS allows read-through and write-through to/from underlying HDFS or any other Hadoop compliant file system with zero code change. Essentially GGFS entirely removes ETL step from integration.GGFS has ability to pick and choose what folders stay in memory, what folders stay on disc, and what folders get synchronized with underlying (HD)FS either synchronously or asynchronously. GridGain is working on adding native MapReduce component which will provide native complete Hadoop integration without changes in API, like Spark currently forces you to do.
