  "description": "Buildoop is an open source project licensed under Apache License 2.0, based on Apache BigTop idea. Buildoop is a collaboration project that provides templates and tools to help you create custom Linux-based systems based on Hadoop ecosystem. The project is built from scrach using Groovy language, and is not based on a mixture of tools like BigTop does (Makefile, Gradle, Groovy, Maven), probably is easier to programming than BigTop, and the desing is focused in the basic ideas behind the buildroot Yocto Project. The project is in early stages of development right now.",
