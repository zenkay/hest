The primary index is a log-structured merge tree (LSM-BTree) implemented using 'doubling sizes' persistent ordered sets of key/value pairs, similar is some regards to LevelDB. HanoiDB includes a visualizer which when used to watch a living database resembles the 'Towers of Hanoi' puzzle game, which inspired the name of this database.",
