  "description": "Edis is a protocol-compatible Server replacement for Redis, written in Erlang. Edis's goal is to be a drop-in replacement for Redis when persistence is more important than holding the dataset in-memory. Edis (currently) uses Google's leveldb as a backend. Future plans call for a multi-master clustering model. Near term goals are to act as a read-slave for existing Redis servers.",
