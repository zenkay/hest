The current Hadoop implementation of the MapReduce technique uses a single job tracker, which causes scaling issues for very large data sets. The Apache Hadoop developers have been creating their own next-generation MapReduce, called YARN, which Facebook engineers looked at but discounted because of the highly-customised nature of the company's deployment of Hadoop and HDFS.\nCorona, like YARN, spawns multiple job trackers (one for each job, in Corona's case).
